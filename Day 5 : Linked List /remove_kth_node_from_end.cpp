/**
 * Approach: Two pointer Approach
 *      - we can find the nth node just by one traversal by using a pointer approach.
 * 
 * Intuition: 
 * 
 *      1. We have the flexibility of using two-pointers now.
 *      2. We know, that the n-th node from the end is the same as (total nodes â€“ n)th node from the start.
 *      3. But, we are not allowed to calculate total nodes, as we can do only one traversal.
 * 
 * What if, one out of the two-pointers is at the nth node from the start instead of the end? Will it make anything easier for us?
 * Yes, with two pointers in hand out of which is at the n-th node from the start, we can just advance both of them till the end simultaneously, once the faster reaches the end, the slower will stand at the n-th node from the end.
 * 
 * 
 * Approach: 
 *      1. Create two pointers slow and fast and initialize them to a head pointer.
 *      2. Move slow ptr by one step and simultaneously fast ptr by two steps until fast ptr is NULL or next of fast ptr is NULL.
 *      3. When the above condition is met, we can see that the slow ptr is pointing towards the middle of the Linked List and hence we can return the slow pointer.
 * 
 * 
 * Time Complexity : O(N)
 * Space Complexity : O(1)

Node* removeKthNode(Node* head, int n)
{
    Node* fast = head;
    Node* slow = head;     

    // Start traversing until the fast pointer reaches the nth node.
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fast = fast->next;
    }

    if(fast == NULL) {
        return head->next;
    }

    // Now start traversing by one step both of the pointers until the fast pointers reach the end.    
    while(fast->next != NULL) {
        fast = fast->next;
        slow = slow->next;
    }
    
    // When the traversal is done, just do the deleting part. Make slow pointers next to the next of the slow pointer to ignore/disconnect the given node.
    slow->next = slow->next->next;
    
    return head;

 * Approach 2 : Using Recursion
